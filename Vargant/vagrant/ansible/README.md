# Ansible

These are some simple VM builds for use with my Ansible introductory articles, so there is nothing of intrinsic value here.

To build them, navigate to each directory and use the "vagrant up" command.

```
cd ansible-server
vagrant up

cd ..\appserver1
vagrant up

cd ..\appserver2
vagrant up

cd ..\database1
vagrant up
```
